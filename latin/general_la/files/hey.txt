***Audio_06_12_2022_07_15_11.mp3

quintus actually wrote a guide to how to win the council ship
 and scholars judge it to be authentic
 cicero
 left the preacher ship in the year 66 and an obligatory two years had to pass before he could be caught he could become console so he began campaigning for console basically a year in advance

***Audio_06_12_2022_07_19_03.mp3

cicero's main rival for the console ship was catalina
 he was an aristocrat who had not yet son is wild oats and his main plank was a cancellation of debt

***Audio_06_12_2022_07_26_14.mp3

catalina was essentialist
 he kept the bodyguard people accused him of
 having sex with his bodyguards
 has comforter a word devotional
 they're mostly a young man he was a cauldron of
 sexual passion
 however later in life
 cicero gives a more balanced picture of him
 21 cicero defends one of kathleen's
 former followers

***Audio_06_12_2022_07_29_09.mp3

and the year 65
 cataline was charged with
 extortion since he was maybe governor of a province in africa
 two of the consoles at that time
 were ran out of office due to illegality and catalan wanted to stand for the vacant seat
 but he had this charge hanging over his head
 and it's possible that he tried to seize the vacant seat by force and kill many of the senators but we have no way of knowing if this is true because the only way we know about it is from campaign speeches by cicero and campaign speeches are not done under oath

***Audio_06_12_2022_07_45_09.mp3

the senate understood that cicero was the least of the evils
 even though he was a new man and they hated new man
 but they certainly didn't want catalina to be council so they tighten the rolls on plus cicero would not corrupt himself he would not
 bribe to get votes so it's possible that the senate
 tighten the corruption laws
 just before the election just so that cicero would win

***Audio_06_12_2022_21_21_35.mp3

cicero
 thought about
 trying to aid
 catalina in his court case in exchange for his vote or getting out of the election
 this is one of the three times on record when
 we have cicero
 participating in the abiding of corruption

***Audio_06_13_2022_07_15_00.mp3

that was a economic recession in the year 63 when cicero was counseled

***Audio_06_13_2022_18_59_38.mp3

there was some land reform law that

***Audio_06_13_2022_19_06_35.mp3

cicero's counselor yerba got off to a bad start the tribune's put forward a land reform bill
 it was going to take land public lands give them to either the poor or the soldiers and also buy out private land on a voluntary basis it was going to be composed of a commission of 10 men who would serve for 5 years
 cicero was indebted to many of the mounties
 and he didn't want to offend them plus he was becoming more conservative
 so he opposed the bill but it also seems that the bill never came to a vote by the general assembly
 also
 it offended pompeii who was getting ready to have a lot of soldiers who needed land
 next cicero defended someone a former consul in court for extortion
 caesar
 who was the prosecutor
 and caesar and his gang then performed a remarkable kill

***Audio_06_13_2022_19_08_52.mp3

titus flavius who would go on to become one of caesar's best generals
 indicted
 chaos
 rebellious i think on the charge of murder 30 that happened 30 years ago

***Audio_06_13_2022_19_09_55.mp3

caius ribeiro's
 he wasn't aj senator apparently he had climbed on a roof and killed saturninus with a rain of tiles

***Audio_06_13_2022_19_13_52.mp3

the senate had a law passed where actually this was an old law where the console could execute people
 without due process and times of emergency it was called the final act of the senate
 and
 the tribunes were the popular as they never accepted this law because it gave the upper classes are the optimal days too much power
 so
 kyosho. had killed saturninus but it was actually well known that
 somebody else had killed a friedman had killed sector 9 us so it seems that caesar
 we're defending
 kyuss
 an attempt to
 stick up for the lower classes
 they wanted to say at 5
 tom
 cicero really did have the power to use this law of executing someone without due process so
 it seems like this was a test
 for our future to buy catalan cuz he wanted
 caesar thought that cataline was going to eventually try to take over the government that he would need protection from that final act

***Audio_06_14_2022_03_00_19.mp3

in cicero's defense of
 i forgot he was he's defending it's either titus or riparius
 but
 cicero made the argument that
 we must have the ability to
 clamp down on conspiracy and plots and execute people who are trying to overthrow the state
 there was getting ready to be a verdict
 and
 a senator used an obscure procedure that was meant to hold up the senate
 what she did was he went out to some hill and the flag was not flying then that meant there was an enemy attack and that
 all business had to stop
 the role was still in force so
 all business stopped and a vote i don't know why but
 it was up to caesar to bring the trial again to trial for a verdict and caesar never did this pretty strange to me

***Audio_06_14_2022_03_02_53.mp3

it was the same yarn which cicero was counseled that caesar ran for chief pontiff he spent so much money on the election that he told his mother if he didn't win he was not coming home and other words he was committing suicide

***Audio_06_14_2022_03_04_56.mp3

so pissy up
 put forward a bill to increase the penalty of bribery or some other kind of corruption to 10 years exile thought himself
 to be the target of the bill and its 10. he decided to lodge his plot
 on july 1st 2
 i don't know exactly what he was going to do yet

***Audio_06_14_2022_03_06_36.mp3

quintus curius was a co-conspirator with kathleen chat line actually plan to assassinate
 cicero and other politicians
 on the day of the elections so curious
 his wife or girlfriend or whatever full vip think her name was she learned of the plot
 from curious

***Audio_06_14_2022_03_08_34.mp3

fovea was friends with tarantula so she told
 tarantula everything she knew tranche of course told cicero and full view decide to become a regular informant of
 cicero
 and curious eventually
 got out of the fly and went to cicero side
 there's a scene in which cicero questions cut the line about his intentions i don't think this is the new the famous 1st in catalina

***Audio_06_14_2022_03_14_19.mp3

cicero began to wear a breastplate so as to protect himself some of this he still yet didn't have a lot of evidence some of the senators thought he was making mountains out of a molehill and had trouble taking him seriously he was still a parvenu
 it's around this time that they think that crassus and caesar left the cathline conspiracy
 catiline's major co-conspirators at this time where lentulus
 and another of solace generals whose names i forgotten
 there's a law in the conspiracy from july that's when
 they were having elections for next year next year as consul and they thought the catalan would strike then
 so there's a lot of up until october 20th

***Audio_06_14_2022_03_17_52.mp3

crassus then came forward and gave letters to cicero which constituted proof that cut the line was indeed
 plotting a conspiracy his co-conspirator was manly as who was a former general of cicero
 the senate still had trouble taking cicero seriously and his phrase i have been informed that which opened all of his announcement started to become a catch phrase or a manlius did rhys and summon his army
 and began to try to take some towns
 i think his first attempt failed cataline kept his nerve and continued with the conspiracy

***Audio_06_14_2022_03_20_43.mp3

cataline was arrested and
 he was given the choice of where he should be arrested
 and he eventually chose to be rest arrested
 at a friend of his whose wife was claudia who might have been the clodia also named lesbian of ketolysis poems

***Audio_06_14_2022_03_26_03.mp3

apparently cut the line was not arrested
 so there was a meeting of the senate and
 i guess calphalon thought that news of manlius is rebellion was not known or they didn't know that he was connected to manlius but for whatever reason cataline showed up at the senate
 and it's there that cicero gave his famous speech
 in the speech
 cicero informs us that
 catalina planned on sending two friends to cicero's house to assassinate them their plan was to
 convey the day's readings and enter cicero's house and then once entered they were going to kill him

***Audio_06_14_2022_03_28_17.mp3

cicero then motioned to banish kathleen but the senators actually demurred and didn't do it but cicero was taken aback by this but then he asked if they would banish a more respectable person forget the person's name and they said of course not so then cicero used
 the senate's that fact to prove that because the senate was silent
 because they didn't refuse to
 banish him that they approved banishing him

***Audio_06_14_2022_05_02_05.mp3

so cataline
 that
 there was no hope for him
 with his conspiracy
 so he had to use the military option so he left rome and
 joined manlius is camp

***Audio_06_14_2022_05_02_44.mp3

before he left manlius is camp he
 wrote a letter
 2
 he wrote a letter explaining his actions
 can he said he tried to say that
 you know he was a good guy he championed the oppressed peoples
 my honor was being threatened
 so i had to
 i had to fight this attack on my honor
 just because i was champion oppressed peoples that sort of thing

***Audio_06_14_2022_05_08_41.mp3

for strange reasons that are in comprehensible
 lentulus stuck to the plot
 and he was going to attack on saturnalia
 he was going to assassinate some senators on saturnalia
 by the way they gave out our presence during this holiday is probably where that's probably what christmas got presents from
 meanwhile so pissy are prosecuted
 morelia
 for corruption or something like that and cicero defended him and gave a famous speech

***Audio_06_14_2022_05_14_23.mp3

lunch and then made a huge mistake a gallic tribe came to rome on some diplomatic mission
 and lentulus tried to bring them into his conspiracy he tried to get them to offer military support
 they later ratted on him and told some romance it would just eventually got back to cicero cicero told one of the members of the galaxy tried to get documentary evidence have lunch let's write a letter so that we can have more evidence
 and in this way the conspiracy was found out lentulus was actually a preacher he had to resign that office one of the other conspirators had a lot of weapons at his home

***Audio_06_14_2022_05_22_27.mp3

they now have to decide whether or not
 to execute the conspirators
 if the conspirators went to a trial there could be bribery
 and they could be acquitted
 cicero consulted the senate about what to do
 most favored execution caesar however was against the death penalty
 and he
 sad that i'm not worried about cicero but a future console could use
 the death penalty despotically
 moreover cataline had been caught at the head of a rebellious army
 but lentulus had not he just was caught with weapons or at least one of his co-conspirators was
 further cicero worried all those cicero alder the council did have the power of execution
 he could be tried for crimes when he left office so cicero was worried about this

***Audio_06_14_2022_05_27_38.mp3

marcus porcius cato now enters the book or the narrative
 he
 could speak for a very long time he did not rehearse his public speeches
 he was incorruptible and honest
 he was austere in this living though he did drink a lot of alcohol he had a rigid mind
 he had trouble
 changing as mine or seeing other people's points of view or admitting he was wrong
 okay and i think he was related to cato the elder somehow
 only one senator rebuffed caesars speech caesars
 rejection of the death penalty then cato makes a speech
 really common sense always like look these people are trying to kill us there's an army out there plotting on a massacre we've got to we've got to take them we've got to kill them
 before they kill us

***Audio_06_14_2022_05_37_20.mp3

cicero ultimately favorite execution
 cato accused caesar of being part of the conspiracy
 they eventually decided on execution and
 there was a big celebration after they died caesar cicero was greeted like a hero and crowds came out to pat him on the back that sort of thing

***Audio_06_14_2022_05_39_00.mp3

to be fair to catalina it was said that he managed to
 recruit 20000 soldiers to his side

***Audio_06_18_2022_07_23_22.mp3

cicero couldn't stop talking about his suppression of the catalan conspiracy and his consular year

***Audio_06_18_2022_07_26_16.mp3

salah naat salah but pompeii was jealous of caesar's i mean cicero's consular year and putting down the conspiracy
 popeye actually wanted
 the
 he wanted to take his army and defeat cataline so that he could get some of the glory
 so pompey had one of his brother's name metolius
 betel traditionally a console would give a speech on the final day of the year
 recounting what he had done for the republic but metolius as tribune veto this and said that could cicero could only make the tradition
 table office

***Audio_06_18_2022_07_29_59.mp3

metellus then put forth a decree to be voted on
 first it was for pompeii to put down the cataline conspiracy but cataline was already dead then it was a bill for pompeii to be council in his absence but i don't really know who his refers to the line he was a console cicero he was leaving the council ship

***Audio_06_18_2022_07_31_29.mp3

during the vote metellus unleashed some gladiators on the saying to attack the senators and they all ran away
 except for cato who held his ground

***Audio_06_18_2022_07_32_59.mp3

the vote never took place
 and
 the senate voted to ban metellus and caesar from official functions

***Audio_06_18_2022_07_39_21.mp3

caesar actually
 some people demanded that he be reinstated and he told them to go home and the senate was so pleased by caesars good behavior that is he was actually pretty sure at the time his office as praetor was restored

***Audio_06_18_2022_07_44_13.mp3

cicero bought a home
 did used to belong to crassus and the nice part of rome for 3.5 million sesterces by this time he had eight houses
 apparently his father on the pretty nice one even though his father was humble

***Audio_06_18_2022_07_47_54.mp3

it's at this time that klodian
 came from the claudia's family though he took the popular name the popular form of his name it's at this time if he comes on the scene
 he
 tried to infiltrate the festival of the good cardist in which only women were allowed he dressed up in drag and a woman asked him a question and his masculine voice gave him away

***Audio_06_18_2022_07_50_54.mp3

i think klodian was trying to have an affair with caesar's wife
 andie case caesar divorced her after the good goddess of fair i'm not exactly sure why
 and claritin is related to cicero at this time because cicero breaks his alibi in criminal case

***Audio_06_18_2022_16_29_20.mp3

celia's had an affair with one of claudius's sisters who may have been less or one of the sisters may have been lesbian of catalyst
 there were rumors that
 claudius and incest with his sister
 and one of them actually it wasn't a rumor it was an accusation under oath in court

***Audio_06_18_2022_16_32_47.mp3

anthony had an affair with klodian claudius's wife full via
 but later married her

***Audio_06_18_2022_16_37_24.mp3

cicero liked kyle who was a friend of claudius
 claudius was a member of cicero's bodyguard during his counselor year
 and
 tarantula worried that cicero was attracted to
 claudia
 catullus also wrote a poem about cicero and praise

***Audio_06_18_2022_20_50_13.mp3

cicero road is the only evidence of homosexuality on cicero's part was love o that he wrote to a slave tiro but it's best seen as a
 imitation of greek love poetry
 we believe that his sister i was on homosexual because he explicitly decried it and
 he was rarely accused of being such

***Audio_06_18_2022_20_50_51.mp3

he
 this comes up because he brought on he like to bring up young man and help them out kylie us was one of them so anyway claudius was charged due to the good goddess scandal
 and a special tribunal regional was appointed to handle it

***Audio_06_18_2022_20_56_33.mp3

tarantula prodded cicero to testify against
 claudian
 because
 she wanted him to prove to her that
 he didn't like his sister
 he agreed to do it
 because at the festival the good god as claudius said that he was in some other town when when the scandal happened
 cicero agreed to testify that he had seen claudius in rome
 it would have been an open-and-shut case for crassus to side i forget what process like claudian claudian but crassus i decided to bribe the jury
 and
 even help them out with prostitutes or
 that sort of thing and
 although he was not able to bribe everyone
 claudia mastella
 equator and so claudian and cicero will now become animes for the rest of their life

***Audio_06_18_2022_21_01_59.mp3

pompeii defeats mithra. he's in the middle east
 he is very successful in the middle east he comes back to italy and expands his army much to everyone's relief
 he knew that if anyone tried to move again some he could raise another army and he had the cash to do it
 and that she had a lot of friends so he felt no threats
 are the senate distrusted him because he had too much power

***Audio_06_18_2022_21_05_32.mp3

cicero felt that pompeii
 i represented a threat to the existing order because he was too closely aligned to radicals in the popular race
 he wrote a letter to pompey but pompeii
 just missed it
 with just a perfunctory reply perhaps because cicero had really no power base
 pompeii how ever did decide to move a little bit to the center by divorcing his wife who was whose brothers were popular

***Audio_06_18_2022_21_10_01.mp3

pompeii was a popular ice
 because his soldiers were popular ice and
 so he wanted to send it to give them land he agreed to delay his
 demand for that till the next year

***Audio_06_18_2022_21_22_05.mp3

i think we're in the year 62 or 61 now
 well
 the equities had immunity from prosecution while they sat on a jury this was taken away by the senate which and all this
 the senate didn't have that immunity either so it that just brought the equities equal to the senate
 are they really resented this but they kept their feelings to themselves
 cicero felt this harm the harmony of the classes

***Audio_06_18_2022_21_32_09.mp3

pompeii tried to get his lambo form bill passed
 but of course the senate didn't like that
 they saw themselves in competition with pompey
 they thought the land would be taken away from them
 pompey had flavius i think introduce i forgot to flavius was but definitely a pumpy ally flavius tried to
 tried to institute try to get up introduced to pay i'll try to get a pass but the senate veto.
 and flavius ultimately tried to block the door to the senate house with his body but
 also the console had flavius arrested before i am but somehow he got out
 so in any case the council just dug a hole through the senate and they were able to get into that way but public opinion turned against flavius so pompeii's landfill did not pass
 and he was upset force

***Audio_06_18_2022_21_37_11.mp3

it was during this time that
 cicero wrote an epic poem
 about his consular year
 but for those letters we know that he didn't take it seriously and neither did his readers and he was mocked for his literary pretensions

***Audio_06_18_2022_21_41_40.mp3

at around this time you're 60 quintus is governor of a certain province i forget which one
 punishes to parasites in the traditional roman manor i don't know if that was
 revision astoria or reactionary but he also while punished of fratricide in the same manner but this fracture
 quint
 quintessa spoke fluent greek red play-doh also wrote tragedies in his spare time

***Audio_06_18_2022_21_50_58.mp3

around this time the year 60 the triumphant
 was getting ready to form
 i think it was pumpease idea
 she wanted caesar because
 are there interest for similar caesar
 was going to get land reform passed as council cuz dr60 would be as consular year
 he would
 to some tax reform he would also settle the the question of pompeys lands in the east
 so because caesar was going to anger some people with his consular year and when he left office he needed protection that's why he would be a good member of the child

***Audio_06_18_2022_22_38_02.mp3

so cicero decides not to join the first triumvirate
 caesar becomes council and he introduces his land reform bill to settle pompey soldiers the senate finds little objectionable in it but cato filler buster's in and talks to the end of the night

***Audio_06_18_2022_22_39_46.mp3

caesar decided to use his powers
 cohen kitagawa which allowed him to arrest people so we can put care do in jail
 many senators however preferred cato's company and shale to caesars in the forum by the way the senate did oppose caesar's land reform bill lock stock & barrel

***Audio_06_18_2022_22_43_36.mp3

caesar been decided to ignore the senate was eventually released the seas are done decided to ignore the senate because after all they couldn't pass laws and take his loss directly to the people however is co-counsel bibulous was an ally of the senate and he decided to block everything caesar dead and he promised that there would be no innovations during caesars term

***Audio_06_18_2022_22_46_29.mp3

another strategy that fabulous used was to declare holidays for all of the remaining days that the general assembly met but caesar just ignored days
 so then on the day when they were going to vote on on the land reform bill
 caesar brought some veterans and they used violence to
 shout down bibulous when he announced the video
 so the bill was passed but
 it was done unconstitutional a

***Audio_06_18_2022_22_48_17.mp3

the next land reform bill was much harsher it was designed to redistribute land to roman citizens that had more than three children
 it was public land but it was rented out and got a lot of our revenue for the roman state

***Audio_06_18_2022_22_49_55.mp3

the second land reform bill was actually passed baby list
 then try to hold everything by announcing bad omens
 there was then a plot to declare all of caesar's laws unlawful after he left office

***Audio_06_19_2022_07_14_11.mp3

cicero began to criticize the triumphant caesar responded by making his enemy claudius a plebeian which allowed him to become a tribune
 caesar also tried to use the carrot approach by offering him envoy to egypt
 or other blandishments but he turned these all down and he momentarily left public life and took a tour of his villas

***Audio_06_19_2022_07_19_02.mp3

in the year 59 or 58 cicero to atticus saying that pompeii is
 trying to obtain absolute power
 it was also around this time that freedom of speech started to decline

***Audio_06_19_2022_07_25_20.mp3

clarity and also they brought in a role where a sensor could expel senators
 for the first time brain was fray
 they prevented quitting the doll that says tribune they prevented
 the council from declaring holidays on
 days when the general assembly met

***Audio_06_19_2022_07_27_38.mp3

klodian also
 inherited a lot of cataline supporters
 he was a serious politician and did things
 not exactly legal aid but he didn't calls revolution

***Audio_06_19_2022_07_29_52.mp3

claudine also developed the concept of an armed gang which could at a moment's notice
 use violence to get what they wanted politically

***Audio_06_19_2022_07_44_06.mp3

cicero eventually found a tribune who agreed to block all of our veto all of claudians legislation but then klodian entered into an agreement with cicero where
 he agreed to not prosecute cicero for executing kathleen and exchange for cicero not blocking
 claudians legislation
 claudian eventually renege on this promise and
 a nerd a law which punished anyone who executed people without due process
 caesar was using claudian to keep the senate
 from looking at caesars caesars own legislation
 which state did not like

***Audio_06_19_2022_07_51_28.mp3

klodian was able to remove the obstructive cato from the scene by appointing him as an ambassador to cyprus
 cato did it like this but as a strict constitutionalist he felt that it was his constitutional duty

***Audio_06_19_2022_15_56_49.mp3

claudius now began to attack cicero he bought off the two councils by giving them the two provinces
 edina introduced the bill that
 would prosecute anyone who had executed someone without due process

***Audio_06_19_2022_16_02_14.mp3

that low actually was already on in the books but claudius
 restated it or whatever just to make a point that he was
 after cicero

***Audio_06_19_2022_20_27_03.mp3

cicero began to
 walkabout with a non shaved beard and bad close this was a common roman sign for
 people who were in the morning or feared prosecution
 but in cicero's case it was literally true that he feared prosecution
 some other senators began to do likewise
 this upset klodian and on one occasion he surrounded the senate house with armed men
 and the senate ran out with are torn clothes but no violence and sued
 pompeii at this time begins to avoid cicero king exactly i don't know exactly why i like he feels like maybe he betrayed some promises or didn't keep promises to make the cicero i'm not sure but i want to taste and cicero goes to poppy's house and pump goes out the back door
 claudian is more successful in stirring up the popular rage against the sorel and now in cicero walks about town
 some of claudius armed gangs will pelt him with eggs
 she'll eventually on the advice of hortencias cicero decides to get out of town

***Audio_06_19_2022_20_31_59.mp3

cicero
 now claudius makes cicero's exile
 legal they get a law passed banning him 400 miles from rome
 many people ignored the law
 i don't know how they were able to claudius was able to get this law passed but he did
 cicero goes to grace
 notably his wife does not join them there because he believes that she can be more useful in rome fighting for his interests
 cicero was very emotional and may have contemplated suicide in exile

***Audio_06_19_2022_20_33_53.mp3

also
 claudius burn down may be all of cicero's houses but definitely the ones in rome
 and the temple of liberty was put in there

***Audio_06_19_2022_20_38_23.mp3

atticus inherited a lot of money for my uncle and now he's able to give cicero financial support cicero also blamed
 his exile on atticus for not doing enough
 pretty sure that atticus didn't respond to this

***Audio_06_19_2022_22_35_04.mp3

all those convenience was a one-time friend of kathleen and was co-counsel i think in the year 58
 they're going to champs to bring to revoke cicero's exile 8 out of 10 tribune's voted for that but it was blocked by
 claudius or claudius

***Audio_06_19_2022_22_37_50.mp3

los angeles was canceled for the year 57
 claudius his term ended as tribune
 on december 31st 58
 lencho has introduced a bill to revoke cicero's exile
 everyone voted for it claudian used his gladiators to prevent the bill from being signed and
 in this riot cicero's brother quintus barely escaped with his life
 that was also what time when when claudian sicced his goons on pompeii
 and we're not exactly sure why and pompey was held up in his house
 it could be that claudine was just trying to assert his independence from his patrons we don't really know what was going on there

***Audio_06_19_2022_22_44_30.mp3

there was discussion on how to bring about cicero's return
 one idea was to invalidate all of claudius's laws
 because he had illegally
 change the stairs from patrician to plebeian but this was not a good idea because of upset too many plebeians
 also cato
 it was an uncompromising constitution less didn't want his annexation of cyprus revoked and it's slightly hypocritical on cato's part that he was willing to bend the constitution when it favored his interests

***Audio_06_20_2022_01_13_48.mp3

they then decided to have a boat to get cicero back none of the tribune's video that i'm they still didn't somehow they came up with some special commission data still didn't trust them all because claudius had a lot of our allies with the mob says
 i think it was a special commission and also the senate ratified it done all i'm also surprised at how many groups took an interest in this issue all kinds of workers collectives in labor unions passed resolutions i think these were just resolutions asking for cicero to return
 claudius spoke against the return but he didn't have any power

***Audio_06_20_2022_07_13_16.mp3

cicero his first speech ron returning from exile unfortunately was mostly a list against those who had harmed him

***Audio_06_20_2022_07_20_53.mp3

that was the issue of what to do about cicero's burned homes
 on one of them there was a temple and the religious authorities had to be consulted about what to do with it
 agreed to compensation for his houses
 the one in rome was a judge that two million sesterces although sister up all that for three and a half million
 that was a home at tusculum for 300,000 and then one at 4 monday for 200,000
 these were much cheaper than they were worth and cicero was very upset with
 this valuation and he believed that his friends in the senate we're merely fair weather friends

***Audio_06_20_2022_07_24_34.mp3

klodian returned to his violent ways he wanted to run for the aedile ship he also sent his gangs on ground
 beating people up so they threw rocks at quintus house they stayed some riots
 and then they attacked cicero himself and he had to run and hide and somebody's house
 another of claudius's
 animes was milo
 who i think was a sort of the band that used the same tactics
 so he attacked him

***Audio_06_20_2022_07_30_08.mp3

there was now a
 problem about both len trellis
 who i think was council and 58th and pompeii both wanted to be governor of egypt although egypt was not exactly a province of rome
 pompey had difficulty making his demands explicit
 the senate didn't want pompeii to be governor of egypt because that would make him more powerful and they didn't want anyone single man to be too powerful said the senate began to ally itself with klodian

***Audio_06_20_2022_07_32_45.mp3

clarity and edwin the aedile ship and he brought my load of court for the illegal use of force

***Audio_06_20_2022_22_06_49.mp3

during the debate for the governorship to egypt
 i'm not exactly sure where this debate happened i guess it's in the senate
 klodian used violence again to influence the debate for some reason the collodion wanted crosses to have the governorship of egypt
 i bet that was a lot of fighting going on

***Audio_06_20_2022_22_11_39.mp3

and do your 56 cicero gives a speech i don't know what speech it was where he says that
 we have to
 kikkoman stir fry sodium content in peace with dignity
 or
 we have to we don't have foreign enemies the enemies come within
 power has to shift back from the popular eyes to the senate slightly compromising in my opinion also there's a possibility at this time that the first break down since
 crisis has mostly broken from the triumph ears

***Audio_06_20_2022_22_28_43.mp3

the triumphrat met at lucca again
 are not again in around 56 or 55 and it made another agreement crassus would get a military command in syria
 pompey and caesar would also get further five-year commands caesar would get the continue being commander and call pompeii maybe it was in spain or something i don't know
 they would stand for council again and hopefully win and exchange favors that sort of thing so in other words the triumphant was not breaking up but was hardening

***Audio_06_21_2022_05_02_14.mp3

pompeii made a threat to quintus that cicero had better support the new land bill
 cicero fell in line and did not repel so i guess he understood the futility of resisting the first triumvirate

***Audio_06_21_2022_05_14_48.mp3

cicero got really depressed after he
 stop fighting the triumphrat
 he also at the summer on the airport t5
 he hires a
 a slave named cheero i don't know if he's asleep or not but a tutor to teach his children

***Audio_06_21_2022_05_15_32.mp3

also pompey and crassus or maybe was caesar they want council ship as planned

***Audio_06_21_2022_16_06_16.mp3

caesar at this time makes a loan to cicero of 800,000 sister sees and appoints his brother quintus as a commander for his campaign in gaul

***Audio_06_21_2022_16_09_06.mp3

during his campaigns caesar road off of volume on latin grammar and dedicated it to cicero
 cicero is fun with writing another epic
 i guess about his consular year

***Audio_06_21_2022_16_19_06.mp3

crisis actually had 42 thousand men when he invaded parthia and was killed

***Audio_06_21_2022_16_22_14.mp3

it was around the year 54 that cicero was appointed to the college of augurs

***Audio_06_21_2022_16_41_59.mp3

after
 claudius was killed by one of my last gladiators due to an accident at the crossroads a riot broke out in rome and the senate had to
 or the government had to find a way to pacify order pompey was asked to put down the riot
 pompey however wanted to be dictator if he wanted to be given power unconditionally plus he wanted to confer with caesar
 so as to preserve the alliance eventually pompeii was given everything he wanted and the riot was put down
 ironically claudius was killed near the shrine of a good near shrine of a of the good goddess
 it's around this time that tiara comes on the scene he helps out cicero with his illiterate compositions
 and he
 let's see here
 he was eventually freed in the year 53
 but
 he continued to work for cicero and cicero viewed him as a member of the family

***Audio_06_21_2022_17_49_30.mp3

cicero did not like his
 his governorship in silecchia
 it was away from the form his friends his family but it was only one year so i decided to stick it out
 i also forgot to mention that when
 julius caesar's
 daughter died and pompeii was free to remarry he remarried someone from the senate which showed his rep rosemont to the senate rather than caesar's something someone close to caesar

***Audio_06_21_2022_17_53_56.mp3


***Audio_06_21_2022_17_54_24.mp3

i forgot that not only did for the governor's not take a salary they had to
 they had to pay their own way
 cicero
 did not have a doorkeeper at his residence as governor he let anyone visit him he also provided lavish hospitality not allowing entertainers to show up for pay or something like that

***Audio_06_21_2022_17_55_07.mp3

also the previous governor of silecchia had been
 have been clodia clawdeen's brother pool care

***Audio_06_21_2022_18_02_04.mp3

an invasion was getting ready to happen
 from the parthians and the governor of syria who would have had to defend as well was an alcoholic
 and it wasn't even certain that he had shown up to
 begin his duties

***Audio_06_21_2022_18_05_35.mp3

cicero marsh's to take care of the end of may he also get some help from the king of capadocia who says he's uncovered a plot against cicero cicero also becomes good friends with the king of cappadocia
and so cicero is leading an army also longinus had
 father an exploratory in persian from the parthian

***Audio_06_21_2022_18_10_55.mp3

cicero beats back the army babyliss on the other hand the governor of syria loses a cohort cicero's hoping for at least a novation he doesn't take himself seriously as a general but he does lead an army
 he
 then sets himself to govern
 as he said as he wrote a letter to quintus and 61 about how to be a good governor
 key
 he believed in taxcollect station because it was a payment for peace but he did not like the way text farmers of course extorted money from the taxpayers however he had spent his whole life defending the businesses to business class or the equities so the tax farmers expected cicero hotel help them out

***Audio_06_21_2022_18_17_48.mp3

the senate was now trying to prevent caesar from becoming console
 they did this by the kept talking about who his successor would be
 and proposing a successor caesar wood
 combat this by having a tribune
 vtel which was the tribune was paid for by caesar

***Audio_06_21_2022_18_22_24.mp3

cato's half-sister was the mother of marcus brutus

***Audio_06_21_2022_18_24_05.mp3

although marcus brutus
 was known for his integrity he was the questor of the province that cicero was now governing in the year 54 and cicero had discovered.
 brutus had let someone
 money at the extortionist rate of 4% per month

***Audio_06_21_2022_18_25_18.mp3

marcus brutus tried to get the governor to use his agents
 his government agents to enforce the repayment of the debt
 at first the governor resisted since it was illegal by the way we're not allowed to lend money at interest

***Audio_06_21_2022_18_27_26.mp3

at one point produce used a cavalry to barricade the senate of a certain province and
 5 of the senators died of starvation because of this barricade

***Audio_06_21_2022_18_29_07.mp3

i forgot to mention that cicero
 solve the problem of
 taxation by flattering the tax farmers
 having them over to his house being nice to them that sort of thing and everyone was happy
 the affair with brutus relates to cicero because all of this happened in cicero's province
 and ultimately he resolved the issue
 because
 his term of office ended and we think that brutus eventually won the issue because he was the deputy of the new governor

***Audio_06_21_2022_18_31_17.mp3

and i think
 i have to kiss was married to
 or out of kisses sister was married to cicero's brother quintez atticus's sister was pomponio

***Audio_06_21_2022_18_39_01.mp3

it's at this time that talia mary's dolabella who was her actually her third husband i think
 he's a playboy and an aristocrat
 and he's prosecuting someone that
 cicero's trying to ingratiate himself with i think the former a previous governor of silecchia i think by the name of apuleius
 cicero returns to italy
 pompeii comes down with the sickness and when he recovers everyone's happy for him here only believes that he's very that he's more popular than caesar he says that i only have to stamp my foot and marriott's will come to my aid
